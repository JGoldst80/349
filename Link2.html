I am Jordan Goldstein from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Iâ€™ve been interested in the way that technology influences the business and media world since I can remember. Growing up, I was dedicated to the sport of hockey, particularly the Philadelphia Flyers. I was always interested in all of the ways that I was able to follow the team. Sports Clothing, Memorabilia, Fantasy Sports, and TV programming were everywhere. The team, the sport, and the technology are all part of the brand. I came to the realization that the future of sports, as well as music, entertainment, and advertizing lies in the power of computers and the Internet.  This is what led to my desire to be a part of that important future.</p> 

<p>I studied Media and Information at Michigan State University, while also participating in various relevant activities that Universities have to offer. I have worked on graphic design projects both, alone and as part of a team to achieve specific goals. In 2013, I interned with Meridian Entertainment to gain more industry experience, and to explore a variety of different opportunities relating to the entertainment industry. The world of media and information is something that I have enjoyed, even before </p>

<p>I fully understood what it was. Most importantly, it is something that I enjoy to do. Some of my important assets include, but are not limited to; my industry knowledge, resourceful and quick thinking mindset, and of course, my impeccable work ethic. I believe that the desire to continue to learn is the key to achievement. I hope to be a lifelong student of the technologies that I have always enjoyed</p>
